-> Kalman filter

its iterative probabilistic state estimation algorithm to determine state of the dynamic system
it works in two steps prediction step and correction step
in the prediction step we take the current state and control inputs as a input to predict the next state of the system
in the correction step it uses the sensor observation to limit the states space
kalman filter is for continouhs states space
in kalman filter beleif is represented by mean and covariance
we aslo assume markov assumption while using kalman filter
kalman filter assumes that the prediction and measurement steps are linearly proportional to variables

its light on memory because we only store the previous position
it also assume that the variables are distributed normally
